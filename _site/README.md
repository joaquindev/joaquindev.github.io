#Source code for my blog

Based in the work of [Rosario/Kasper Repository][rosario]. The only change I have made is changing the font-family to *Lato* in `main.css`: 

```ruby
@import url(http://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Lato:400,300,500,700,400italic,300italic);

body {
	font: 17px/25px Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;
  	font-weight: 100;
}
```
