This post is inspired on the great talk that [Victor Powell][url-victor-powell] did in the [Angular.JS Announcements, January 2014][announcements2014] , check out his great website and materials. 

These first steps assume that you know about [Angular.js Directives][angularjs-directives-doc], so check them out if you don't understand them. And now, time to follow the steps of Victor Powell to learn how to unfold all D3 potential with Angular.js directives.
