This is WIP.
I'm a life-long learner, adrenaline seeker and MSc and software developer who loves learning something new everyday.  
I'm passionate about the future of web programming and its design and above all **The Internet of Things** which is the future. 

Developer tags: Node.js, Javascript, CSS, Ruby, Java, .NET, MongoDB, CouchDB, Redis, Docker, Agile, Lean Philosophy and TDD

Fascinatad with good stories and tools that make your life easier as a programmer but more important as a human being, for instance I love the invention of bikes which help reduce pollution and improve your health.
